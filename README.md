SDLoginKit
=======
**Login/Sign-Up ViewControllers Ready-To-Use with your Custom Backend**

Building a authentication system can be tedious and repeative. Why write the same code over and over when you could be spending time working on real application logic? SDLoginKit is a simple library that provides Login and Sign-Up viewcontrollers out-of-the-box. Just subscribe to a few delegate callbacks for success/failure and BAM! You are ready to start managing and creating users. Want to customize the entire experience? No problem just override `loginViewControllerShouldBeginLogin` and all the codez belong to you! You can even add your own logo to the login screen. Just set `logoImage` to the `UIImage` of your choice.

> SDLoginKit is named LoginKit, because it has everything you need add a fully-customizable authentication system to your iOS Application.

SDLoginKit is meant to save you time so you can focus on what matters, application logic. The library is still a little green behind the ears and I would love to see any issues or pull request you may have. There is a sample project if you have any question on how it all works.

Submit an Pull Request/Issue/Enhancement and keep up with my progress in the [worklog](https://github.com/stevederico/SDLoginKit/blob/master/_worklog).

I am working to create pre-defined implementations for different authentication systems like the following:
* Devise
* OmniAuth
* Your-favorite-authenication

Please help me by submitting a generic implementation with your back-end of choice.

Overall, this is a great way to get your authentication up and running then you can go from there.

I also highly recommend you follow [Mattt Thompson](http://www.github.com/mattt) and his series of open source libraries covering the mission-critical aspects of an iOS app's infrastructure. Be sure to check out its sister projects: [GroundControl](https://github.com/mattt/GroundControl), [SkyLab](https://github.com/mattt/SkyLab), [CargoBay](https://github.com/mattt/CargoBay), and [houston](https://github.com/mattt/houston).

## Getting Started

### Create Core Data Models

1. Add `CoreData.framework` into your project
2. Create Core Data Model
3. `#import "SDScaffoldKit.h"` and create an instance with desginated initializer `initWithEntityName:soryBy:context:andStyle:`

```objective-c
  SDScaffoldIndexViewController *scaffoldViewController = [[SDScaffoldIndexViewController alloc] 
    initWithEntityName:@"User" sortBy:@"lastname" context:[self managedObjectContext] andStyle:UITableViewStyleGrouped];
```
Then wrap your `SDScaffoldIndexViewController` instance in a `UINavigationController`

```objective-c 
 UINavigationController *navController = [[UINavigationController alloc] 
    initWithRootViewController:scaffoldViewController];
```
Done!


## Example Usage
```objective-c
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
     // Override point for customization after application launch.
    self.window = [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]];
   
    SDScaffoldIndexViewController *scaffoldViewController = [[SDScaffoldIndexViewController alloc] initWithEntityName:@"User" 
     sortBy:@"lastname" context:[self managedObjectContext]];
    
    UINavigationController *navController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:scaffoldViewController];
  
    self.window.rootViewController = navController;
    self.window.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];
    [self.window makeKeyAndVisible];
    
    return YES;
}
```
